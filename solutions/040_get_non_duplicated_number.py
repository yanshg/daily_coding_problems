"""
This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one integer, which only occurs once, find and return the non-duplicated integer.

For example, given [6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6], return 1. Given [13, 19, 13, 13], return 19.

Do this in O(N) time and O(1) space.

# Idea:
#     Bits in 'ones' are set to 1, when that particular bit occurs for the first time.
#     Bits in 'twos' are set to 1, when that particular bit occurs for the second time.
#     If a bit is occurring for more than 2 times, we throw it away and start couting again.

# ones = ones ^ x:                 If it exists in ones, remove it, otherwise, add it.
#
# ones = (ones ^ x) & ~twos:       If appear once, add it to ones,
#                                  If appear twice (exists in ones), remove it from ones,
#                                  If appear third (not exists in ones), throw it away and do not add it in ones.

# twos = (ones & x) | twos:        If exists in ones, add it to twos
#
# twos = (ones & x) | (twos & ~x): If appear once, remove it from twos
#                                  If appear twice (exists in ones), add it to twos
#                                  If appear third (not exists in ones), throw it away and remove it from twos
#

# Solution:  there are 2 buckets: ones, twos
#   for x in nums:
#       if x in twos:
#            remove x from twos
#       elsif x in ones:
#            remove x from ones
#            add x in twos
#       else:
#            add x in ones
#   return ones
