This problem was asked by Facebook.

A graph is minimally-connected if it is connected and there is no edge that can be removed while still leaving the graph connected. For example, any binary tree is minimally-connected.

Given an undirected graph, check if the graph is minimally-connected. You can choose to represent the graph as either an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.

# Idea: If G is an undirected graph, it's a standard lemma that the following are equivalent:
#       * G is a tree.
#       * G is connected and has no cycles.
#       * G is connected and the number of edges is one less than the number of vertices.
#
# So this is same with problem #280 to check if the graph is connected and has no cycles.
