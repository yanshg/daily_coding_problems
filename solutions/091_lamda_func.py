This problem was asked by Dropbox.

What does the below code snippet print out? How can we fix the anonymous functions to behave as we'd expect?

functions = []
for i in range(10):
    functions.append(lambda : i)

for f in functions:
    print(f())

# This is a issue about Python closures and later binding.
# http://quickinsights.io/python/python-closures-and-late-binding/
# https://eev.ee/blog/2011/04/24/gotcha-python-scoping-closures/
#
# Python closures are late binding. that means:
# The values of variables used in closures are looked up at the time the inner function is called.

# Idea:  re-set 'i' at the time when call the virtual methods due to later binding

functions = []
for i in range(10):
    functions.append(lambda : i)

i=0
for f in functions:
    print(f())
    i+=1


# Another Idea:  use local varible in the virtual method

functions = []
for i in range(10):
    functions.append(lambda x=i: x)

for f in functions:
    print(f())


# Another Example for later binding:

def multipliers():
    return [lambda x : i*x for i in range(4)]

print([m(2) for m in multipliers()]) # [6, 6, 6, 6]

# Solution

def multipliers():
  return [lambda x, i=i : i * x for i in range(4)]

print([m(2) for m in multipliers()]) # [0, 2, 4, 6]
